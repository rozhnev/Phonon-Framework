title: Quick start

Phonon builds are ready to use components. They are located in the `dist/` directory.
They provide convenient solutions that can be installed with no effort and that satisfy the most common editing use cases.

Please, read more about [custom builds](#0_getting-started/2_custom-build) if you would like to optimize the size of Phonon by
importing required components only.

## Installation

The installation can take place in several ways:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/quark-dev/Phonon-Framework/releases) and use dist files.
